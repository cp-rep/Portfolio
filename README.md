# School_Portfolio

## Description
This portfolio consists of a few chosen miscellaneous school programming projects and endeavors.  Examples range from low-level microcontroller projects to complex algorithm benchmarking.  I chose these few examples rather than release a large collection of my school work because they are with a great majority solely my work and my work alone as they are mostly small projects.  I did not want to contribute to facilitating any academic dishonesty.

All included repository work has been left unedited beyond the date in which it was deemed "completed" (i.e. turned in or moved on from).  Everything is written from scratch unless provided by the course and/or course resources.

### Project in Algorithms
Represents roughly a dozen search algorithms including arrays, lists, and graphs.  Thorough benchmarks for these algorithms were written and applied culminating in a detailed analysis for each project.  Project 3 analysis is included.

### Project AVR Hangman
An ATmega32 microcontroller project which represents the game of Star Wars Hangman with a full musical score.

### Project NCurses Paint with Networking
This was a prersonal project I did after completing a class in C.  It is written in C and uses the NCurses library to provide basic "paint" functionality.  Included are both networked and non-networked revisions.  For the networked version, all connection and socket handling are written in C.

### Project Multithreaded Search
A small C project from an early CS class that leverages multithreading through the POSIX standard to search an array for a target value by breaking it into segments that a chosen amount of threads will individually traverse.

### Misc Bash
Various Bash scripts.

### Misc Assembly Assignments
Several simple assembly programs from an x86 Assembly course.
