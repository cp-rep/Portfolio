# Public Portfolio

## Description
This portfolio is a very small, but publicly available, representation of my miscellaneous school programming projects and endeavors.  These specific programs were chosen hoping to provide a broad representation of programming experience.  Some examples range from low-level microcontroller projects to complex algorithm benchmarking.

All included repository work has been left unedited beyond the date in which it was deemed "completed" (i.e. turned in or moved on from).  Any future edits were made only to retain any anonymity.

### Project AWS MapQuest Alarmclock
The Alarm Clock project combines an Arduino Uno, a SparkFun ESP8266 Thing Dev Board, I2C communication, and AWS (Amazon Web Services).  The Arduino communicates with the Sparkfun ESP device which then connects with AWS to query Mapquest for dynamic traffic information for a desired route.  The traffic information for that route is sent back to the Arduino where it is accounted for in a desired set alarm time.

Includes source code for the project and a high-level diagram.

### Project in Algorithms
Represents roughly a dozen search algorithms including arrays, lists, and graphs.  Thorough benchmarks for these algorithms were written and applied culminating in a detailed project analysis for each project.  The analysis for Project 3 is included as I found it the most interesting of the three projects.

### Project AVR Hangman
An ATmega32 micontroller project which represents the game of Star Wars themed Hangman with a full musical score.

### NCurses Paint with Networking
A program written in C that uses the NCurses library to provide basic "paint" functionality.  Included are both networked and non-networked revisions.  For the networked version, all connection and socket handling are written in C.

### Project Multithreaded Search
A C project that leverages multithreading to perform a search.

### Template for C++ Project
A typical extensible project layout I use for most of my Linux-based C++ work.  It adequately organizes my code for small projects while providing up-to-date unit testing functionality with the GoogleTest library.

### Misc Bash
Various Bash scripts.

### Misc Assembly Assignments
Several simple assembly programs from an x86 Assembly course.
