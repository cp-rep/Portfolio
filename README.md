# Public Portfolio

## Description
This portfolio is a small representation of miscellaneous school programming projects and endeavors.  Examples range from low-level microcontroller projects to complex algorithm benchmarking.

All included repository work has been left unedited beyond the date in which it was deemed "completed" (i.e. turned in or moved on from).  Everything is written from scratch unless provided by the course and/or course resources.

### Project AWS MapQuest Alarmclock
Moved to github.com/cp-rep/GoogleMaps_AlarmClock

### Project in Algorithms
Represents roughly a dozen search algorithms including arrays, lists, and graphs.  Thorough benchmarks for these algorithms were written and applied culminating in a detailed analysis for each project.  Project 3 analysis is included.

### Project AVR Hangman
An ATmega32 micontroller project which represents the game of Star Wars Hangman with a full musical score.

### Project NCurses Paint with Networking
A program written in C that uses the NCurses library to provide basic "paint" functionality.  Included are both networked and non-networked revisions.  For the networked version, all connection and socket handling are written in C.

### Project Multithreaded Search
A small C project that leverages multithreading to perform a search from an early CS class.

### Template for C++ Project
A typical extensible project layout I use/adapt for most of my Linux-based C++ work.  It adequately organizes my code for small projects while providing up-to-date unit testing functionality with GoogleTest.

### Misc Bash
Various Bash scripts.

### Misc Assembly Assignments
Several simple assembly programs from an x86 Assembly course.
